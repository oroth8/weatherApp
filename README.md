This website is a weather application. A user enters a valid city and the current forecast along with the five day forecast are displayed onscreen. Users last search city is stored in local storage. Users can navigate through previous searches in the left hand search column. This application was built to test my knowledge with APIs. [Open-WeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api)
